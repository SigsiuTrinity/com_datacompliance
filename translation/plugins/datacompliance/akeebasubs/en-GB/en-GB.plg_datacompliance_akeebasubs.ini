PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_DESCRIPTION="GDPR Data Compliance plugin for Akeeba Subscriptions"

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ERR_HASSUBS="You have purchased %u subscription(s) within the last %u days. We cannot delete your account until this many days elapse since this information is used for tax reporting and as evidence of service provisioning in case of a payment dispute."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_1="Your abandoned subscription attempts (where you never tried to pay) will be deleted."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_2="All other subscriptions and subscription attempts (where you tried to pay, no matter if it was successful or not) will be pseudonymized by replacing the transaction identifier with a random one and removing the IP address and browser User Agent information from them. Any notes we had made on the subscription, e.g. recording a special circumstance for giving you a discount, will be removed."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_3="All invoicing information we have collected on our system will be removed."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_4="All invoices and credit notes will be removed from our site. Clarification: we are legally required to keep a backup copy of the actual invoices and credit notes and an off-line record with their metadata for at least ten fiscal years since the transaction took place. This obligation overrides your right to be forgotten per the GDPR, therefore these copies will not be deleted but they will also not be used for any other purpose than taxation and legal obligations of the company."
