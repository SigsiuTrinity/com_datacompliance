<p>Hello [NAME],</p>
<p><strong>KEEP THIS EMAIL FOR YOUR RECORDS</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the European Union''s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and / or equivalent laws abroad we are obliged to delete the personal information of inactive user accounts on our site. Account inactivity is determined by several factors, such as when was the last time you logged into your account on our site. Your user account has been determined to be inactive and has, therefore been deleted.</p>
<p>The exact actions which took place on our system to delete your user account are as follows:</p>
<p>[ACTIONS]</p>
<p>Please note that this email was prepared <em>right before</em> the deletion took place, that''s how we were able to send it and address it to you.</p>
<p>Now that your account has been deleted from our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can no longer log in (your account has been <em>removed</em>)</li>
<li>all your information has been deleted or anonymized per the actions listed above <em>permanently</em> and can <em>never be retrieved or restored again</em></li>
<li>according to the provisions of the law you are no longer considered a client (past, current or prospective) of ours and we cannot even check whether you have ever been a client of ours</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to kindly remind you that deleting your user account is the direct result of a <strong>LEGAL REQUIREMENT</strong>. We did not do it to inconvenience you. We deleted your information because we are forced to do so by the law (we have no choice). Moreover, it is <strong>ILLEGAL</strong> for us to keep a copy of your information, therefore we can not restore your deleted information even if you ask us. Finally, we''d like to remind you that you received an email from us stating that this would happen unless you logged into our site.</p>
<p>This is the final communication you are receiving from us notwithstanding any response to any communication that <em>you</em> initiate in the future or have already initiated outside our web site such as but not limited to email, social media, electronic messaging platforms, letter, telephone, short message service (SMS a.k.a. "texts") or in person. We would like to kindly request that you do not ask us to restore your deleted information because it''s both impossible and illegal.</p>
